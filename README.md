# vs-2017-themes
Some variants of the Material theme: https://github.com/Microsoft/VS-ColorThemes/blob/master/VSColorThemes/Themes/MaterialDark.xml

The themes were quick edits and I only tried it with C#. If there are any issues, make changes with the extension as you see fit.

Requires the Color Theme Editor extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2017ColorThemeEditor#overview
